# Reinforcement Learning Exercises

## Introduction

After completing the [Coursera Specialization on Reinforcement Learning taught by the University of Alberta](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning), I was motivated to put what I learned to use with a modern Deep Learning framework like Pytorch.

I was initially struck by the Mountain Car problem in the Sutton and Barto text book which was featured in the course, so I began my exploration by replicating their Sarsa results with Q-learning.

My ambitions are to work my way through A3C and PPO papers on simple problems, then replicate DeepMind Atari game playing paper, and finally to build my own Starcraft 2 bot to play Zerg. For the Swarm! ;P
